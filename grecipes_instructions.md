## Decoupled Applications

* The front end and the back end will have **SEPARATE REPOS**. No forking and cloning for this project. Create brand new repos. 2 repos per team.
* Deploy the front end to Firebase
  * You can mock out data so you don't have to wait for it with a tool like [json-schema-faker](https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker)
* Deploy the backend to Heroku (If you try to use `res.render` on the server, you will probably have a bad time.)
  * You can test out your API without a frontend using tools like `curl`, `http`, and `POSTman`
