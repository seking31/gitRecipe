## Decoupled Applications

* The front end and the back end will have **SEPARATE REPOS**. No forking and cloning for this project. Create brand new repos. 2 repos per team.
* Deploy the front end to Firebase
* Deploy the backend to Heroku (If you try to use `res.render` on the server, you will probably have a bad time.)
